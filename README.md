# JSMixins Pattern - (https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins)
Mixins are a great compromise vs straight-forward delegation (invoking any public function directly via ``call`` or ``apply``)
and having gnarly labyrinths of meaningless subtypes (inheritance)
Understanding JS mixins:
Functional units to be borrowed and accessed with minimal syntax and they play very well with prototypes.
1. Classic Mixins - classic-mixins.js
2. Functional Mixins -functional-mixins.js
3. Adding Options - adding-options.js
4. Adding Caching - adding-caching.js
5. Adding Curry
